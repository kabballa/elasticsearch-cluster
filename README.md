### What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a distributed database that provides a powerful, scalable, and fault-tolerant solution designed for high availability and performance. It is optimized for use cases that require efficient data retrieval and storage, making it an ideal complement to data visualization tools in clustered environments.

### What is Kibana?

Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that works in conjunction with Elasticsearch. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana allows users to create interactive dashboards, generate reports, and gain insights from their data through various visualization options, such as charts, graphs, and maps.

### Overview of Elasticsearch and Kibana

Elasticsearch and Kibana work together to provide a robust data storage and visualization solution for high-demand applications. By utilizing Elasticsearch for efficient data retrieval and storage, applications can significantly reduce response times and database load. Kibana enhances this by offering powerful visualization capabilities, enabling users to analyze and interpret their data effectively.

## Project Structure

- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Defines services for Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- **Networks**: Configured for application services.
- **Volumes**: Data persistence for Elasticsearch instances.

## Services

### Elasticsearch Servers

Three instances of Elasticsearch are configured:

1. **es1**
2. **es2**
3. **es3**

Each instance:
- Uses the image `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.0`.
- Sets memory lock limits.
- Maps local port `9200` to container ports `9200`, `9200`, and `9200`.
- Persists data in separate volumes.

### Usage:
1. **Start the services**: Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Elasticsearch instances.
2. **Point your application**: Configure your application to connect to the Elasticsearch instances for data retrieval and analysis.

### Kibana

- Image `docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.17.0`.
- Links to the three Elasticsearch instances.
- Command configuration for data visualization operations.
